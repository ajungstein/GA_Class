DS | Lesson 1

### STUDENT PRE-WORK
*Before the first class, you should have already:*

- Installed Python (2.7)
- Installed Anaconda
- Created a github account

*Before this lesson, you should already be able to:*

- Define basic data types used in object-oriented programming
- Recall the Python syntax for lists, dictionaries, and functions
- Create files and navigate directories using the command line interface (for their specific environment)

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Describe the roles and components of a successful learning environment
- Define data science and the data science workflow
- Apply the data science workflow to meet your classmates
- Setup your development environment and review python basics

*After the first week, you should be able to:*

1. Utilize unix commands to navigate the file system and modify files
  - Summarize a basic filesystem structure, including absolute and relative paths
  - Use the most common commands to navigate and modify files / directories via the Terminal window.

2. Write programs that utilize the different data types
  - Describe the concept of a "data type" and how it relates to variables
  - Identify and define variable with the following data types: int, float, string, boolean, list, and dictionary
  - Write code that uses conditional statements to control the flow of a program

3. Write functions that accepts a parameter and solves a problem
  - Describe how parameters and arguments relate to functions
  - Create and call a function that accepts parameters to solve a problem
  - Return a value from a function using the return keyword
  - Define and call functions 

4. Write for loops that iterate over arrays and loops
